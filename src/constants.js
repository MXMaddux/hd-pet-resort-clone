            review: "I have been taking my precious baby Remington to HPR for over a year. He is excited every morning on our way to daycare. He jumps out of my arms into the counselors arms every morning which ensures me that he is being taken care during the day. Pet counselors, front office staff and groomers are excellent,professional and easy to work with!"

            review: "We are newer to the area and were on the hunt for a regular groomer for our goldendoodle as we hadn't had great luck. We received a recommendation for Diana at Henderson Pet Resort and I'm beyond grateful we did! Not only did she do a phenomenal job, but she is also incredibly kind. I felt like I was leaving my boy with a family member. I have never felt as comfortable nor...{''}"

            review: "Huge thanks to Gabriel and staff for taking our dogs for a walk in nail trim! Gabriel informed us about one of our dog's nails that no other groomers told us about. Gabriel was really gentle, friendly and informative. Would highly recommend if you ever need a groomer to ask for Gabriel!"

            review: "The day after my review was written, Emily, one of the managers gave me a call to go over what had happened. She was extremely apologetic and explained that that this is not how they run their business, which I do know from going there the past 7 years. I also understand that it has been hard to get/keep good staff. She did put me on the waiting list and... "

            review: "My cat Charlie spent a couple of days at the Henderson Pet Resort. They took good care of him. I even had his claws trimmed, which was badly needed. He was happy to be home, but didnâ€™t appear to be traumatized by having been there. Like my previous cat had been at other places. Will definitely send him again. Thanks for taking great care of my Charlie."
